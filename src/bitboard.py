bitboard.py

A simplified bitboard system inspired by Stockfish’s C++ implementation.
It represents the board as a 64-bit integer and precomputes utility tables
such as SquareDistance. It includes functions to generate sliding moves for
rooks and bishops (without magic bitboard optimizations) and to compute
pseudo-attacks for knights and kings. This module serves as a starting point;
for a full-speed engine, consider a more optimized (and low-level) solution.
